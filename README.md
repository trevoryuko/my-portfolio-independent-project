## Description
This is a portfolio landing page project I was assigned to create. It contains a brief description about me, my skills, my other recent projects and some of the projects I have created.
## Setup/Installation Requirements
Since this is  a website it does not need to be installed all it neeeds for it to work and operate is:
* An up-to-date web browser.
* Internet access wih stable speeds. 

A list of browsers you can use to access this website is Mozila Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, Torch Browser, Brave, Safari Browser (Mac), Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Internet Explorer, UC Browser...
At least I gave you a hint of some of the web browsers you can include on your PC or phone. 
## Known Bugs
As of the moment I have no known bugs. The only issue you might encounter is when you try to send me a message via the contact me form and it does not respond. We although are trying our best to fix that.
## Technologies Used
I used a bit of HTML to design the overview and CSS to style the website.
## Support and contact details
